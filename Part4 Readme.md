How did I change design to reduce its delay? 
I chose to parallelize and add register between multiplication stage and adder to reduce critical path. We would wait for the last input to be written into X, then use parallel multipliers to generate 64 partial products. (a0*b0, a0*b1, …, a7*b6, a7*b7). These partial products wait at their respective registers. In the clock cycle, we group these partial products by 8 each(each row of w by vector) and add them 8 of them in a bunch, using the combinational arithmetic to produce 8 outputs in the same cycle. We do not write new inputs to memories until all outputs are read by the testbench. The 8 outputs of one matrix vector mul &acc operation, are stored in a 2*2 array named ‘sum’, of size 8 and width 28-bit each. Controlpath relying on a output tracking counter and output_ready signal, passes array position to the sum which then loads the value at that position to the variable output_data. 
I tried to build controlpath to simultaneously write inputs while computing output data,  spent good time trying to understand the flow and find probable conditions when in a state. We started off it with hunch in mind that this type of design would give best performance , but it is complex in designing FSM as there are quite a few events happening at each stage.
Unfortunately, I do not have working code for now, I gave structure to my idea and placing the uncompiled code here, it has issues with multi-dimensional arrays. It is still work in progress and I wish to finish it. 
If all set of data required for an operation can be read simultaneously instead of in a serialized manner, 71 clock cycles can be reduced when writing into memory and save 7 such when outputting data. Design for part1 takes total 81 cycles. So new design would take only 3 cycles instead of 81!!
